General-Code-Snippets
=====================

Some useful Unity3d code snippets for Visual Studio.

## Automatic Installation

Just run appropriate install.bat from the build folder.

## Manual Installation

Copy all the folders in the source folder into your Visual Studio Code Snippets directory.  Generally this will be:

    C:\Users\{username}\Documents\Visual Studio 20XX\Code Snippets
    
Just substitute your username and Visual Studio edition.

## Compatibility

These snippets have been *mostly* tested against Visual Studio 2013, but will probably continue to work for future versions of Visual Studio.

I guarantee nothing :P
